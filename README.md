# Reading-Siblings-Reading-List
My sister reads, like, a lot. And I read a good amount, too. We had one big problem though. My sister was keeping track of her reading in a shoddy Excel spreadsheet, and I hadn't logged any of my reading. We decided we needed a better system to record what we read during the year.

The Reading Siblings' Reading List was born.
